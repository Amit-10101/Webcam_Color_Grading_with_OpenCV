![Real-Time Color Grading](https://img.shields.io/badge/Real--Time%20Color%20Grading-OpenCV-blue?style=for-the-badge)

Welcome to the Real-Time Color Grading system for your webcam! This Python script leverages OpenCV to perform real-time color grading on your webcam feed, allowing you to explore different color modes and effects on the fly. With this tool, you can experiment with various color spaces and even create artistic visual effects.

## Usage

1. **Grayscale Mode**: Convert the live webcam feed to grayscale.
2. **HSV Mode**: Switch to the Hue-Saturation-Value (HSV) color space.
3. **LAB Mode**: Experience the L*a*b color space for unique color transformations.
4. **Inversion Mode**: Invert the colors by converting the feed from BGR to RGB.

## Instructions

1. Clone the "Webcam_Color_Grading_with_OpenCV" repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Amit-10101/Webcam_Color_Grading_with_OpenCV.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Webcam_Color_Grading_with_OpenCV
   ```

3. Run the Python script:

   ```bash
   python color_grading.py
   ```

4. Choose an option by entering the corresponding number and explore the real-time color grading effects.

   - Press 'q' to exit the webcam feed.


## Applications

- **Artistic Exploration**: Experiment with different color modes and effects to create unique visual styles for your projects.
- **Image Processing Education**: Learn about color spaces and real-time image processing in Python.
- **Computer Vision**: Integrate this script into computer vision applications to manipulate color information for improved object detection and tracking.

Feel free to fork this repository and customize the code to suit your specific needs. Enjoy exploring the fascinating world of real-time color grading with OpenCV!
